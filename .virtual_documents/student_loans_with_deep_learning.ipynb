# Define the target set y using the credit_ranking column


# Display a sample of y



# Define features set X by selecting all columns but credit_ranking


# Review the features DataFrame






# Split the preprocessed data into a training and testing dataset
# Assign the function a random_state equal to 1






# Create a StandardScaler instance


# Fit the scaler to the features training dataset


# Fit the scaler to the features training dataset









# Define the the number of inputs (features) to the model


# Review the number of features



# Define the number of hidden nodes for the first hidden layer


# Define the number of hidden nodes for the second hidden layer


# Define the number of neurons in the output layer



# Create the Sequential model instance


# Add the first hidden layer
